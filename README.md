scaffolding step

when i ran npm run reset-project
1. it asked if i want to move existing files to /app-example instead of deleting them
2. I entered yes 
3. then it created the app-example directory and moved the components, hooks, scripts and constants to the app directory file
4. And recreated a new app directory with just index.tsx amd _layout.tsx
